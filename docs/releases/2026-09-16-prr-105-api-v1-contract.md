# PRR-105 — Verifiable API v1 contract

- Status: PARCIAL; no production-readiness claim.
- Branch: `feature/production-control-plane-phase-11`
- Base SHA: `1ce3bf1f3ce131da01809583d19ac6d9d029afe3`
- Phase/domain: PRR-105, API transport contracts and four supported consumers.
- Risk/tier: HIGH / DEEP for public compatibility, authentication and financial contract review.
- Migration: NONE.
- Skills: architecture-guardian, backend-fastapi, security, testing, release; payments for financial contract review.
- Required design/final-review model: `gpt-5.6-sol`; isolated deterministic generation is eligible for Terra only after the design is established. Execution model is operator-selected for this session; this runner does not switch the current model.
- Escalation: ambiguity in supported public behavior, unrepresentable runtime validation, missing financial idempotency, unsafe output, or two substantive verification failures.
- Acceptance: deterministic generated OpenAPI; exhaustive route classification; runtime/request/response/error/auth/pagination parity; actual old/new consumer compatibility; protected baseline and breaking-change CI; full regression and exact-SHA CI.

## Authority and scope

Zod schemas and the mounted Express route/middleware graph are the existing runtime authorities. There is no existing OpenAPI document. Output projections and consumer assumptions currently live in separate JavaScript/TypeScript code; they must be audited before any response schema is claimed complete. Zod transforms and cross-field refinements cannot silently become permissive JSON Schema.

The approved user prompt authorizes PRR-105 only. PRR-106, other waves, F11 runtime, production, Markets and CASH remain outside this delivery. New financial defects must remain explicit blockers rather than being given undocumented guarantees in OpenAPI.

## Findings under verification

- Legacy normalization retains `name`, `zipCode` and `scheduledTime` after deriving canonical fields; strict runtime schemas reject these supported old requests.
- Both mobile consumers issue bodyless cancellation/rejection; the PRR-104 schemas currently require an object even when reason is optional.
- Payment-intent preparation writes `PROCESSING` after an earlier unlocked read. A competing successful payment capture can be overwritten; reproduction and domain impact remain under review.

## Evidence and closure

Implementation, remote CI, consumer coverage and remaining gaps will be recorded only after execution. Missing evidence keeps PRR-105 PARCIAL. No tracker may mark it HECHO on the basis of this record alone.

## Partial implementation, 2026-09-17

Legacy alias consumption and optional body handling are corrected with runtime-validator regression tests. A deterministic source inventory, structural JSON Schema checks, route-stack comparison, four-consumer path/method observations and breaking-change detector unit tests exist. The inventory is explicitly NOT an approved OpenAPI publication. Output schemas and full consumer compatibility remain unproven. The CI stale-inventory check and isolated PostgreSQL financial acceptance are added without weakening any existing gate.

GitHub CLI authentication check failed: the existing account credential is invalid. No token value was printed. Remote exact-SHA CI cannot be credited from the historical baseline. The financial race is currently a source finding with an acceptance test, not yet a PostgreSQL-confirmed result.

Partial implementation commits:

- Legacy compatibility: `6b0a207e`.
- Deterministic source inventory: `573e5af6`.
- CI/invariant acceptance: `dbe0aa75`.

Local evidence on 2026-09-19:

- `npm run verify`: PASS (backend 274/274; Admin 15/15 plus production build; Public Web 4/4 plus production build; Customer 5/5 plus typecheck; Professional typecheck).
- `npm --prefix backend run api:inventory:check`: PASS and deterministic.
- Prisma format check, validate and generate: PASS. Migration: NONE.
- All six npm audit scopes: 0 vulnerabilities, including 0 HIGH/CRITICAL.
- Repository secret-shaped fixture/artifact hygiene guard: PASS.
- Route inventory: 251 operations: 29 CANONICAL_V1, 51 LEGACY_SUPPORTED, 163 ADMIN, 6 INTERNAL, 1 WEBHOOK, 1 DEPRECATED, 0 REMOVAL_CANDIDATE.
- Consumer inventory: 139 calls; 9 dynamic calls unresolved. Schema bindings: 329; wire parity unproven for 242.
- PostgreSQL migration replay, RBAC, integration/concurrency acceptance, tracked/full-history secret scan and exact-SHA CI: PENDING REMOTE CI.

OpenAPI version: NOT PUBLISHED. Closure SHA: NONE. Production activated: NO. Markets activated: NO. CASH active: NO. F11 runtime started: NO. Missing acceptance evidence keeps this work open.
